Abstract: 
Fake news could spread misinformation, influence decision-making (such as voting), and use emotional extreme statements to sway opinions. Therefore, tools that could be used to decipher legitimate news articles from fake opinionated pieces are critical. In this project, we developed a fake vs. true news detector by applying two different machine learning algorithms - CNN and RNN. We compared the results, and found that the CNN model showed better results of accuracy and loss from training and testing, as well as confirmation with K-fold validation.
